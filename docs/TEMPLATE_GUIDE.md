## ðŸš€ Steps for New Template Creation

1. **Name Convention**

   - Always append `Caffeine UI` to the template name.
   - Example: `Business Profile â€“ Caffeine UI`, `Event Promo â€“ Caffeine UI`.

2. **Branding**

   - Use the **project/business-specific logo** on the cover (front-facing identity).
   - Add a **"Powered by Caffeine UI"** tag + logo in the footer or back page.

3. **File Handling**

   - Save the template as a **PBR file** (or other target format).
   - Keep filenames consistent:
     ```
     <template-name>-caffeine-ui.pbr
     ```

4. **Code Annotations**

   - Each main file should start with a comment block noting template rules (see below).

5. **Library Placement**
   - Place the finished template inside `/templates` (or your chosen folder).
   - Update `/docs/TEMPLATE_INDEX.md` if you keep a running catalog.
